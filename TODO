1. virtual environment for handling  propagator(can it be compose with reactivity?)
generalize is unusable value to any unusable value done 

DELAYED blueprint done
i thought about building dynamic propagator 
which can build and unbuild on runtime
but then i think it introduce too much complexity
maybe its better to keep the propagation graph extend only on startup
edit is only possible in runtime
so its reflexive inspectability but also avoid unnecessary footgun


// next focusing on implement 
carrying cells done

and higher order propagators that recursion over carrying cells

recursion

victor clock for reactivity done 

disposing done

scheduler determinsitic replay

2. unify reactivity and supported value with generic merge  done 


MEMORY LEAKKKKKK solved 

revert memory testing to the last one  done 

it should only dispose the propagator done
