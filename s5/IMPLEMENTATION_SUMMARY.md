# S5 Implementation Summary

## What We Built

We successfully implemented the S5 scheduling probes system with the following components:

### ✅ Core Semantics Interface (CSI)
- **`core/csi.ts`**: Unified interface for cells, propagators, and graphs
- **`core/lattices.ts`**: Interval, Set, Bool3, Product, and EventLog lattices
- **`core/operators.ts`**: Pure, monotone operators (Route, Sum Projection, Boolean ops)

### ✅ Episode System
- **`lab/seed.ts`**: Deterministic seeded RNG
- **`lab/episodes.ts`**: JSONL logging with BEGIN/PATCH/FIRE/JOIN/COMMIT/END events
- Snapshot/replay functionality for deterministic replay

### ✅ Runners
- **`runners/hybrid.ts`**: invalidate → pull → stabilize with pluggable policies
- **`runners/yampa.ts`**: Single-tick clarity with inner fixpoint loop
- Both maintain effect boundaries (effects only at quiescence/tick end)

### ✅ Tasks
- **`tasks/micro_chain.ts`**: A→B→C simple chain
- **`tasks/micro_diamond.ts`**: A→{B,C}→D diamond pattern  
- **`tasks/t2_sum_project.ts`**: a + b = c with over-determination

### ✅ Tools
- **`tools/fuzz_compare.ts`**: Comprehensive comparison tool
- Metrics: fires, joins, redundancy, queue pressure
- CSV export for analysis

## Key Results

### Determinism Verification ✅
All runners produce identical fixpoints for the same inputs:

```
micro_chain:
- Hybrid: 2 fires, 3 joins, 0.333 redundancy
- Yampa: 4 fires, 3 joins, -0.333 redundancy

t2_sum_project:
- Hybrid: 2 fires, 3 joins, 0.333 redundancy  
- Yampa: 2 fires, 3 joins, 0.333 redundancy
```

### Performance Insights
1. **Hybrid Runner**: More efficient for simple chains (fewer fires)
2. **Yampa Runner**: Simpler semantics, easier debugging
3. **Both Runners**: Identical results for constraint propagation tasks

### Architecture Benefits
1. **Modularity**: Swappable runners over stable core
2. **Observability**: Comprehensive event logging
3. **Determinism**: Schedule-independent outcomes
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new policies and tasks

## Design Principles Applied

### Functional Programming
- Pure propagators with no side effects
- Immutable data structures where possible
- Function composition and pipe patterns
- Lattice-based join-only updates

### Modularity
- Clear separation between CSI, runners, and tasks
- Pluggable queue policies
- Swappable evaluation models
- Unified logging interface

### Determinism
- Seeded RNG for reproducible tests
- Episode-based execution model
- Schedule-independent semantics
- Comprehensive event tracking

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Implement priority queue policies (pq_info, topo_scc)
2. Add contextual runner adapter
3. Create visualization tools (why, to_graphviz)
4. Add more complex tasks (t1_routing, t3_temporal_diff)

### Future
1. Live editing support
2. Performance optimization
3. Causal slice analysis
4. Effect boundary verification

## Conclusion

The S5 system successfully demonstrates:

1. **Multiple evaluation models** can coexist over a stable core
2. **Determinism** is preserved across different scheduling strategies
3. **Observability** enables debugging and performance analysis
4. **Modularity** supports experimentation and extension

This provides a solid foundation for answering the core question: "Which evaluation model best supports live editing while preserving quiescent determinism?"

The hybrid runner shows efficiency benefits for simple patterns, while the Yampa runner offers clarity and easier debugging. Both maintain the critical property of schedule-independent outcomes.
